The goal of this project is to be able to use the Power Profiler Kit II with a Skyhawk device, WITHOUT the need for a laptop.
My setup includes a Raspberry Pi 5, running the Ubuntu Server OS (a.k.a. "headless" Ubuntu). The RPi is connected to a Nordic 
Power Profiling Kit II, which is connected to the positive and negatve terminals of a Skyhawk device.

This project was made possible by IRNAS' python-based [Power Profiler API](https://github.com/IRNAS/ppk2-api-python)
